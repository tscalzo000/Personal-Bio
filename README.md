# Tori-Scalzo

I've created a little personal bio based on Facebook's open-source 'Create React App' to showcase work with an API and React.

## Setup
After downloading my project, navigate to the project folder and run the following:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

And in a new terminal window:

```
$ node server.js
```

Navigate to <http://localhost:5000> to view the app.
