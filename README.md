# Tori-Scalzo

I've created a little personal bio webapp based on Launch Academy's
'Launch-Academy-FAQ' assignment. The content of the following files were
created by me:

-App.js
-Question.js
-QuestionList.js
-data.js
-main.js
-app.scss

## Setup
After downloading my project, navigate to the project folder and run the following:

```
$ npm install
$ webpack-dev-server
```

And in a new terminal window:

```
$ node server.js
```

Navigate to <http://localhost:8080> to view the app.
